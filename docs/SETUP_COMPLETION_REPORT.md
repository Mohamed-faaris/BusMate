📝 `user_logged_in` - Properties: userId, email  
📝 `seat_selection_started` - Properties: userId, busId, boardingPointId  
📝 `seat_selected` - Properties: userId, busId, seatId, gender, boardingPointId  
📝 `seat_booking_attempt` - Properties: userId, busId, seatId, status, failureReason  
📝 `seat_booking_completed` - Properties: userId, busId, seatId, boardingPointId  
📝 `bus_route_viewed` - Properties: userId, boardingPointId, busId  
📝 `admin_model_created` - Properties: adminUserId, modelId
